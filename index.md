# Hi There!

I'm Kojo Acquah. 

Currently, I'm a Software Engineer in Seattle, WA working at Google in research and machine intelligence. In the past, I've worked in multiple techincal internships, the MIT Media Lab, and MIT CSAIL. I hold a M.S. & B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from The Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

When I'm not working, I'm an avid video gammer, LEGO builder, and life-long photographer.
